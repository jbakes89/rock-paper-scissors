# Rock Paper Scissors

## for The Odin Project

---

This was completed as part of the Odin Project Foundations course as an exercise in basic programming principles using JavaScript.

### Things I've learned/practised:
- How to setup a basic game loop
- How to receive, process, and respond to user input
- A way to implement enums in JavaScript (not sure if this is a good method or not though...)

### Things to add/improve:
- GUI
- Tracking historical results
- Smarter AI that learns from user patterns(?)

## Adding GUI using Javascript
starting Jan 19th, 2020

In this update, instead of running the game in the console, we will had a GUI using Javascript to allow the user to play the game in the browser.

This is part of the **DOM Manipulation** lesson in the Odin Project Foundations course.
