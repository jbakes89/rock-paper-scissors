# Rock Paper Scissors

## for The Odin Project

------------------------

This was completed as part of the Odin Project Foundations course as an exercise in basic programming principles using JavaScript.

### Things I've learned/practised:
- How to setup a basic game loop
- How to receive, process, and respond to user input
- A way to implement enums in JavaScript (not sure if this is a good method or not though...)

### Things to add/improve:
- GUI
- Tracking historical results
- Smarter AI that learns from user patterns(?)
